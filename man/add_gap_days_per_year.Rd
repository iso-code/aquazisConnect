\title{Count the number of days with data gaps per year and append the result to a result tibble}
\usage{
add_gap_days_per_year(
  gap_info,
  result_tbl = NULL,
  station_no = NA,
  year_start,
  year_end
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gap_info}{Dataframe with at least a 'start' column (POSIXct) containing the start of each gap.}

\item{result_tbl}{(Optional) An existing result tibble to append to. Default: NULL (a new tibble will be created).}

\item{station_no}{Station number to assign to the result row.}

\item{year_start}{Start year of the evaluation period (inclusive).}

\item{year_end}{End year of the evaluation period (inclusive).}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per station and one column per year in the range, containing the number of days with gaps.
}
\description{
This function takes a gap table (gap_info), calculates the number of days with data gaps per year for a given year range,
and appends the result to an existing result tibble (result_tbl). If result_tbl is NULL, a new result tibble is created.
}
\examples{
result_tbl <- add_gap_days_per_year(gap_info, result_tbl = NULL, station_no = 12345, year_start = 1991, year_end = 2021)
}
