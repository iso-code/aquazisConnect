\title{Detect Gaps in a Time Series}
\usage{
detect_gaps(datetime, value, expected_interval = "hour")
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{A numeric vector of measurements corresponding to \code{time}. Only
used to align timestamps; gaps are determined from \code{time}.}

\item{expected_interval}{A string specifying the expected interval between
consecutive timestamps. Supported values: \code{"min"}, \code{"5min"},
\code{"10min"}, \code{"15min"}, \code{"30min"}, \code{"hour"}, \code{"day"}.
Defaults to \code{"hour"}.}

\item{time}{A vector of timestamps (character, Date, or POSIXct).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the detected gaps with columns:
\describe{
\item{start}{Timestamp at the beginning of the gap.}
\item{end}{Timestamp at the end of the gap.}
\item{gap_minutes}{Duration of the gap in minutes.}
}
}
\description{
This function identifies gaps in a time series based on an expected time interval.
A gap is defined as a period where the difference between consecutive timestamps
exceeds the expected interval.
}
\details{
The function first converts the input timestamps to POSIXct. It calculates
differences between consecutive timestamps in minutes, then compares them
to the expected interval. Any difference larger than the expected interval is
recorded as a gap.
}
\examples{
time <- as.POSIXct(c("2026-01-01 00:00", "2026-01-01 01:00", 
                     "2026-01-01 03:30", "2026-01-01 04:00"))
value <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
detect_gaps(time, value, expected_interval = "hour")
